        <h1>Canolitos' Webpage</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my webpage. This is my first attempt building one.<br>
           I hope that I could learn enough in order to build one that looks
           professional.</p>
        <p>Wish me luck.</p><br>
        <p>Let me introduce myself just a bit:</p>
        <p>My name is Jairo. But, I choose JairoRM as my username in many websites. Currently, I
          am studying "Computer Systems Engineering", and I'm learning a lot, although not exactly
          what I want to learn. My dream is to become a programmer, and this engineering program is
          teaching me a lot about other topics. So, I'm teaching myself Web development:
          I'm a self-taught individual.

        <h2>Canolitos</h2>
        <p>You might ask: why Canolitos? Don't you mention you use JairoRM as your username?</p>
        <p>Well... yes. I do use JairoRM as a username. But many years ago, I came up with the word
          'Canolitos' as a username when I first started my adventure with computers. I believe it
          was around the time Windows 95 was launched. I Can't recall exactly how this word came to
          my mind, but I think it was because we had two dogs at home.
        </p>
        <p>Enough about that. Now, I'd like to share some of the projects I'm working on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Systems Engineering</li>
          <li>Web development (self-taught)</li>
          <li>Programming fundamentals (self-taught)</li>
          <li>Algorithms (self-taught)</li>
          <li>Java (mostly self-taught)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's it. That is all I have to say for now.</p>
