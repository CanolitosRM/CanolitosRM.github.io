I'm studying web development as a self-taught learner. This is my attempt at creating a webpage.
I know it's quite basic, but I'm doing my best to learn everything I can in order to make webpages
look professional.

Also, I'm studying English (I'm a native Spanish speaker), but I want to share with the world
everything I'm learning, so English is the best option for that.

## Some changes
Also, I will migrate this to a "Project site" because I want to share my progress as time goes by.
I added this as my "User site" because I was learning about GitHub Pages. Sorry for that.

Wish me luck with my journey with web development and programming in general.
